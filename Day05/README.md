# Security & Networking Concepts

## 1. Micro USB Port
- A **widely used connector** for both charging and transferring data.  
- Mostly found in earlier smartphones, IoT gadgets, and older Raspberry Pi boards.  

---

## 2. Data Exploitation
- **Meaning:** Taking advantage of weak points in a system to **gain unauthorized entry** or **manipulate information**.  
- **Common Methods:**  
  - Guessing or cracking weak passwords.  
  - Inserting malicious code into applications.  
- **Objective:** To leak, alter, or erase confidential data.  

---

## 3. SSH (Secure Shell)
- A **secure communication protocol** for connecting to devices over a network.  
- **Main Uses:**  
  - Logging in to remote servers.  
  - Secure file exchange (via SCP or SFTP).  
- **Protection:** All communication is encrypted, preventing data interception.  

---

## 4. Standard (Low-Privilege) User
- A user account with **restricted rights**.  
- Can only perform essential tasks and access approved files.  
- **Purpose:** Limits damage if the account is hacked.  

---

## 5. Root / Superuser
- The **administrator account** with unrestricted system access.  
- Capabilities: install/remove software, alter system files, and adjust all settings.  
- **Caution:** Misuse of root rights can break or expose the system.  

---

## 6. Privilege Escalation
- **Definition:** When an attacker **gains more access rights** than they should have.  
- **Forms:**  
  - **Vertical escalation:** Moving from standard user to admin/root.  
  - **Horizontal escalation:** Breaking into another user’s account at the same level.  
- **Countermeasures:** Keep software updated, enforce least-privilege policies, and strengthen authentication.  

---

## 7. Bash Script
- A **script file** containing commands written for the **Bash shell**.  
- **Applications:**  
  - Automating repetitive system tasks.  
  - Running server management jobs.  
- **Note:** Saved with a `.sh` extension.  

---

## 8. SOC (Security Operations Center)
- A **dedicated facility/team** that continuously monitors and responds to cyber threats.  
- **Key Roles:**  
  - Continuous threat detection.  
  - Handling and analyzing security incidents.  
  - Managing vulnerabilities.  
- **Primary Aim:** Safeguard the organization’s networks and systems.
