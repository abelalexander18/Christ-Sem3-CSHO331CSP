## 1. Major Divisions in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity work is divided into three teams:

### Red Team (Attack Team)
- Tries to break into systems (like a hacker would)
- Finds weak spots in security
- Helps test how strong the defenses are

### Blue Team (Defense Team)
- Protects systems from attacks
- Watches for threats and blocks them
- Uses tools like firewalls, antivirus, and monitoring systems

### Purple Team (Mix of Red and Blue)
- Works with both red and blue teams
- Shares information between the two
- Helps improve overall security by combining both approaches

## 2. Common Cybersecurity Threats

Cyber threats are ways attackers try to harm or break into systems. Here are some common types:

### Phishing
- Fake messages or emails that trick people into sharing private information like passwords

### Ransomware
- A virus that locks your files and asks for money to unlock them

### Malware
- Harmful software like viruses or spyware that can damage your system or steal data

### Social Engineering
- Tricking people into giving away private information, often using lies or fake identities

### Man-in-the-Middle Attack
- When an attacker secretly listens to or changes the messages between two people or systems

### Zero-Day Attack
- An attack that takes advantage of a software problem that no one knows about yet, so there is no fix

## 3. What is Hacking?

**Hacking** means getting into computers or systems without permission. There are different types:

- **White Hat Hackers**: Good hackers who help fix problems and improve security
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Bad hackers who break into systems to steal or damage
- **Gray Hat Hackers**: In between â€” they may break rules but not with bad intentions

Ethical (legal) hacking is important for testing and improving security.
